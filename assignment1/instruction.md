## Assignment 1

### Introduction

Hi Iza, it's time for your first assignment.

### Initial setup

In order to setup assignment execute following files:

1. [shop.dll](shop.ddl) - creates tables,
2. [test_data](test_data.sql) - populates tables with test data.

### Assignment

Assignment can be found in [assignment.sql](assigment.sql) file.
File contains multiple test cases. Each test case has an brief
description and expected result. I've double check the result but 
if you think that your solution is correct - don't hesitate to reach me.
In order to solve some of the test cases you need use functions not
introduced during our lectures. You need to google it! I have marked it
with `hint` tag.

Good luck!
